subtitle: One place to list all your resources
---

We at Antiquity Probe are trying to create a place where anyone can easily search for and get the resources that they need for their study of History and Archaeology.

Due to the outburst of content and information on the internet in recent times, trying to search for a particular resource has become time consuming, which is a hassle (especially if it's exam season). So, as fellow students, our goal is to make that process of searching for what you need online a little bit easier. We have categorized the list of resources that are available to us right now, like, podcasts, blogs, guides and stuff.

Although nowhere near complete, we will keep updating the website (hopefully on a daily basis). Once this takes a proper form, this place will not only help students but also serve as a platform for all those people genuinely interested in History, Archaeology, and stories around the globe.

### Our Story

We are just a handful of students who are studying history and archaeology, and trying to create something to make life in academia a little easier. Our vision for this project is a really big one and will in no way be an easy task to achieve. But we believe in the miracles that the support from the student community can bring to the world.

Any suggestions from you guys, no matter how small, will be appreciated. We cannot do this alone. Please, support us.

Stay with us!
